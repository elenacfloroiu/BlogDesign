        <h1>What is so speacial about Spain?&#128526;</h1>
        <p class="italic">Posted on March 19, 2020</p>
        <p>
            Passionate, sophisticated and devoted to living the good life,
            Spain is both a stereotype come to life and a country more diverse 
            than you ever imagined. If this is your first time in Spain, here 
            are some good reasons to visit the country…
        </p>
        <p>
            Poignantly windswept Roman ruins, cathedrals of rare power and 
            incomparable jewels of Islamic architecture speak of a country 
            where the great civilizations of history have risen, fallen and
            left behind their indelible mark. More recently, what other country 
            could produce such rebellious and relentlessly creative spirits as 
            Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso and Antoni Gaudí and place them front 
            and center in public life?
        </p>
        <p>
            For all the talk of Spain’s history, this is a country that lives very 
            much in the present and there’s a reason fiesta is one of the best-known 
            words in the Spanish language – life itself is a fiesta here and everyone 
            seems to be invited.
        </p>
        <p>  
            Finally, food and wine are national obsessions in Spain, and with good reason. 
            The touchstones of Spanish cooking are deceptively simple: incalculable variety, 
            traditional recipes handed down through the generations, and an innate willingness 
            to experiment and see what comes out of the kitchen laboratory. You may experience 
            the best meal ever via tapas in an earthy bar where everyone’s shouting, or via a meal 
            prepared by a celebrity chef in the refined surrounds of a Michelin-starred restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            The must-see destinations in Spain:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Barcelona</b> This city bubbles with life in its narrow Barri Gòtic alleys, along 
                the pedestrian boulevard called the Ramblas, in the funky bohemian quarter of El Born, 
                and throughout the chic, grid-planned part of town called the Eixample. It features 
                works by native sons Antoni Gaudí, Pablo Picasso, and Joan Miró.</li>
            <li><b>Madrid</b> Lively Madrid has enough street-singing, bar-hopping, and people-watching
                vitality to give any visitor a boost of youth. It also offers top-notch art treasures 
                (Prado Museum collection, Picasso’s Guernica) along with an unsurpassed tapas scene.</li>
            <li><b>Seville</b> Seville also has its share of impressive sights — but the real magic is the 
                city itself, with its tangled former Jewish Quarter, riveting flamenco shows, and thriving bars.</li>
            <li><b>Granda</b>This city has much to see, yet it reveals itself in unpredictable ways. Settle down 
                in the old center and explore monuments of the Moorish civilization and its conquest.</li>
            <li><b>Toledo</b> Incredibly well-preserved and full of cultural wonder, the entire city has been 
                declared a national monument. Enthroned in its history, this stony wonderland remains the historic, 
                artistic, and spiritual center of Spain.</li>
        </ul>
